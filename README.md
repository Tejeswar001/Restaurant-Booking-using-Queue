This project is a simple restaurant booking system implemented in Python using `tkinter` for the GUI. It demonstrates how to manage customer bookings using a queue data structure. The system allows users to input customer details such as name and the number of people in the booking.

## Features:
- Add bookings with customer name, booking time, and party size.
- Process bookings in a first-come, first-served order.
- Display the current list of bookings in the queue.
- Interactive time selection using dropdown menus for hours and minutes.

This project is designed to help understand basic queue operations (enqueue, dequeue) and how they can be applied in real-world applications like managing restaurant reservations.
